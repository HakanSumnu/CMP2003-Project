# CMP2003-Project

This project was my project for Data Structures and Algorithms Course. Its aim was predicting the rate of a user from the test dataset using the information in the train dataset. I used item-based collaborative filtering method and cosine similarity metric for the prediction of the rates. I made a hashmap structure that contains pointer of another hashmap as its elements. It finishes the calculation around 1.5 minute in my computer.

My computer's specifications:
-CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz
-RAM: 12GB
